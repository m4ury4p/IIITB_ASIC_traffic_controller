# IIITB_ASIC_traffic_controller
Traffic lights are the signaling devices used to
manage traffic on multi-way road. These are positioned to control
the competing flow of the traffic at the road intersections to
avoid collisions. By displaying lights of different colours(red,
yellow and green), they alternate the way of multi-road users.
The implementation of traffic Light Controller can be through a
Microcontroller, Field Programmable Gate Array or Application
Specific Integrated Circuit. FPGA implementation is advanta-
geous over ASIC and microcontroller; number of IO ports and
performance compared to microcontroller and implementation
with FPGA is less expensive compared to ASIC design.

# 1.Introduction
This is a design of a traffic light controller using veriog.
The module will have five parameters to work. There are clock,
reset button, sensors, traffic light on highway and another light
near farm.yo
